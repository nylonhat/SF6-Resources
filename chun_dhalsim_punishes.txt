=== Light Level 2 Super punish in the corner ===
 - Crouch block and react to the release of the ball because Dhalsim may choose to charge the fireball for longer
 - Pay attention to where the fireball is heading
 - Parry the incoming fireball if the Light SA2 version was used. (Otherwise do regular st.HK... route)
 - b.HP after parry will hit when Dhalsim has fallen to his knees after DI crumple (different than usual DI PC combo route)
